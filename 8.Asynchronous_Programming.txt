**Synchronous Execution :** 

Javascript executes code line by line. Almost every programming language executes code line by line. 
But
There will be some kind of code which will take long time to execute..


**Asynchronous Execution :** 

Multiple resources. Multiple executions at a time.

But Js is Single-threaded, it cannot do multiple things at the same time.

Js can act asynchronously with the help of a friend.

Enter Browser API

Whenever Js Engine encounters a piece of code that will take a long time to execute, it hands over its execution to the browser.

Browser now takes care of that task and when it's finished, it pings the Js engine that the task is done.

Thatâ€™s how Js engine and Browser work together to make Javascript capable of asynchronous programming.
