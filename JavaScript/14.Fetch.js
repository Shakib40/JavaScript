// ### API

// Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in programming languages
// to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily.

// They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.

// ### Types of API

// **Browser APIs** — constructs built into the browser that sits on top of the JavaScript language and allows
// you to implement functionality more easily.

// **Third-party APIs** — constructs built into third-party platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) that allow
// you to use some of those platform's functionality in your own web pages 
//(for example, display your latest Tweets on your web page).

// **JavaScript libraries** — Usually one or more JavaScript files containing custom functions that 
//you can attach to your web page to speed up or enable writing common functionality. 
//Examples include jQuery, Mootools and React.

// **JavaScript frameworks** — The next step up from libraries, JavaScript frameworks 
//(e.g. Angular and Ember) tend to be packages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
//other technologies that you install and then use to write an entire web application from scratch. 
//The key difference between a library and a framework is “Inversion of Control”. When calling a method from a library,
// the developer is in control. With a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls the developer's code.


// ### Fetch

// The `fetch()` method in JavaScript is used to request to the server and load the information in the webpages. 
//The request can be of any APIs that returns the data of the format JSON or XML. This method returns a promise.

// The `fetch` API, has been standardized as a modern approach to asynchronous network requests.


// **Why Fetch ??**

// - Clean and easy syntax.
// - Modern way of making network requests.
